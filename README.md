# PROJECT MANGO MELON 

A half-completed photo based social network. Yeah, it's cool. 

Currently in invite-only beta, but it's getting better and better (and will soon be public).  

If you would like to run this on your own computer, just feed the requirements file to pip3 and run with Python 3.6.1+. 
New features are added all the time, so stay tuned!
